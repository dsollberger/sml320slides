Because this approach to learning is different from the competitive classroom structure that many other courses used to be based on, it is important for us to be clear about mutual expectations.  Below are my expectations for students in this class.  This set of expectations is intended to maximize debate and exchange of ideas in an atmosphere of mutual respect while preserving individual ownership of ideas and written words.  If you feel you do not understand or cannot agree to these expectations, you should discuss this with your instructor and classmates.\n\n1.\tStudents are expected to work cooperatively with other members of the class and show respect for the ideas and contributions of other people.\n2.\tWhen working as part of a group, students should strive to be good contributors to the group, listen to others, not dominate, and recognize the contributions of others.  Students should try to ensure that everyone in the group is welcome to contribute and recognize that everyone contributes in different ways to a group process.\n3.\tStudents should explore data, make observations, and develop inferences as part of a group.  If you use material from published sources, you must provide appropriate attribution.\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n(Students will be asked to acknowledge this document in an online form.)\n\nThis document has been adapted from\n*Scientific Teaching*\nby Jo Handelsman, Sarah Miller, and Christine Pfund\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![Scientific Teaching](Scientific_Teaching.png)\n:::\n\n::::\n\n## Pep Talk\n\nLearning R can be difficult at first---it is like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or\nChinese. Hadley Wickham---the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you will be using like `ggplot2`---made this wise observation:\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## Wisdom from Hadley Wickham\n\nIt's easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it's me, I'm really stupid,” or, “I'm not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It's just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don't blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\n:::\n\nIf you are finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions ... e-mail [Derek], etc.  I promise you can do this.\n\n---Andrew Heiss, Georgia State University   \n\n## Inclusion Statement\n\nI value all students regardless of their background, country of origin, race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, etc. and am committed to providing a climate of excellence and inclusiveness within all aspects of the course. If there are aspects of your culture or identity that you would like to share with me as they relate to your success in this class, I am happy to meet to discuss. Likewise, if you have any concerns in this area or facing any special issues or challenges, you are encouraged to discuss the matter with me (set up a meeting by e-mail) with an assurance of full confidentiality (only exception being mandatory reporting of academic integrity code violations or sexual harassment).\n\n\n# Conditional Probability\n\n## Setting\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\nLet us visit the lands of Faer&ucirc;n.

Hadley Wickham---the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you will be using like `ggplot2`---made this wise observation:\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## Wisdom from Hadley Wickham\n\nIt's easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it's me, I'm really stupid,” or, “I'm not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It's just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don't blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\n:::\n\nIf you are finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions ... e-mail [Derek], etc.  I promise you can do this.\n\n---Andrew Heiss, Georgia State University   \n\n## Inclusion Statement\n\nI value all students regardless of their background, country of origin, race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, etc. and am committed to providing a climate of excellence and inclusiveness within all aspects of the course. If there are aspects of your culture or identity that you would like to share with me as they relate to your success in this class, I am happy to meet to discuss. Likewise, if you have any concerns in this area or facing any special issues or challenges, you are encouraged to discuss the matter with me (set up a meeting by e-mail) with an assurance of full confidentiality (only exception being mandatory reporting of academic integrity code violations or sexual harassment).\n\n\n# Conditional Probability\n\n## Setting\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\nLet us visit the lands of Faer&ucirc;n.
