Because this approach to learning is different from the competitive classroom structure that many other courses used to be based on, it is important for us to be clear about mutual expectations. Below are my expectations for students in this class. This set of expectations is intended to maximize debate and exchange of ideas in an atmosphere of mutual respect while preserving individual ownership of ideas and written words. If you feel you do not understand or cannot agree to these expectations, you should discuss this with your instructor and classmates.\n\nStudents are expected to work cooperatively with other members of the class and show respect for the ideas and contributions of other people.\nWhen working as part of a group, students should strive to be good contributors to the group, listen to others, not dominate, and recognize the contributions of others. Students should try to ensure that everyone in the group is welcome to contribute and recognize that everyone contributes in different ways to a group process.\nStudents should explore data, make observations, and develop inferences as part of a group. If you use material from published sources, you must provide appropriate attribution.\n\n\n\n(Students will be asked to acknowledge this document in an online form.)\nThis document has been adapted from Scientific Teaching by Jo Handelsman, Sarah Miller, and Christine Pfund\n\n\n\n\nScientific Teaching"
